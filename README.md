# Rift Sharp Launcher
Many thanks goes out to Novo for creating the original [Rift .NET Reborn Launcher](https://github.com/Novo/rift-net-reloaded/tree/master/Tools/Rift%20.NET%20Reloaded%20Launcher) coded in Visual Basic.

Compared to the old VB launcher the following changes has been done:
* Converted entire project to C#.
* Upgraded to .NET 5.0
* Removed encryption.
* A lot of cleanup.

## Prerequisites
